# SQL-music_project
Portfolio Project on Data Analysis using SQL.

This project showcases how to analyze the Digital Music Store Database. I have examined the dataset with SQL and help the store understand its business growth by answering simple and complex questions based on geographical growth, purchase power, total revenue, genre performance, music band popularity, best city in terms of revenue and best customer in terms of purchase rate. This analysis will provide great insight to the stake holders to take right and effective decisions.

The objectives of this project are as follows:
 Identify the senior most employees based on their job title.
 Determine the countries with the highest number of invoices
 Identify the top three values of total invoices.
 Analyze the city with the most valuable customers and highest revenue.
 Display the city name along with the sum of all invoice totals.
Analyze the best customer and the individual who has spent the most money.
 Identify the genre of all rock music listeners.
 Determine the artist who has written the most rock music in the dataset.
 Analyze the track names that exceed the average song length.
 Determine the amount spent by each customer on artists.
 Analyze the most popular genre for each country.
 Determine the customers who have spent the most on music in each country.
 Provide a list of the top customers and their spending.
